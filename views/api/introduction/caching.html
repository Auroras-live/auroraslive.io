<h2>Caching</h2>
<p>All data returned by the API is cached. Initial caching occurs when data is requested, and subsequent calls return the cached version until they <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Expires" target="_blank">Expire</a>, or after a predetermined period of time (usually 60 seconds). Caching doesn't apply to the request as a whole, but rather to the sub-elements that make up a call. For example, in a typical <a href="#/api/all">all module</a> request, the local weather is cached for one period of time, the space weather for another, and Kp for a different period again. this granularity ensures that the cached information can be shared across multiple requests by multiple users</p>
<p>Archive data is cached permanently, as it's unlikely to change. In this case, caching applies to the underlying SQL query, which is essentially the same as caching the whole request. The first user requesting data between 1am and 3am on the 1st of January 2017 will not get a cached version of the data, but every subsequent request for that exact day and time range will get a cached version</p>
<p>The cache can be invalidated upon request. Please contact <a href="mailto:admin@auroras.live">admin@auroras.live</a> to request this.</p>
