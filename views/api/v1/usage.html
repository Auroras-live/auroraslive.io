<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>The Auroras.live API is presently free to use. In order to use this service, you must attribute Auroras.live as the source of the information, but not in such a way that implies that Auroras.live endorses or is the author of the product. Auroras.live is to be written with a capital "A" at the start, except when referring to the URL. Acceptible attribution includes:</p>
<table class="table" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr><td><i class="fa fa-check"></i></td><td>Powered by Auroras.live</td></tr>
  <tr><td><i class="fa fa-check"></i></td><td>Information via Auroras.live</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Unacceptable attribution includes:</p>
<table class="table" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr><td><i class="fa fa-times"></i></td><td>Written by Auroras.live</td></tr>
  <tr><td><i class="fa fa-times"></i></td><td>An Auroras.live app</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The attribution should be easily findable by users (e.g. in the footer of the page, or under a Help > About menu, for example) and should always be written with a capital A, except when referring to the URL</p>
<p>To obtain a copy of the logo for embedding purposes (e.g. dynamically generated images), please email <a href="mailto:admin@auroras.live">admin@auroras.live</a></p>
<h3>Data limits</h3>
<p>There are presently no limits on the amount of data you can access, except <a href="#/api/v1/archive">the archives</a>, which is limited to a total of 3 days of data per call</p>
<p>However we encourage you to use this API responsibly and to cache requests on your end wherever possible. This API is provided for free and costs real money and time to maintain, so your responsible usage is very much appreciated</p>
<p>API limits may be enforced in the future. These will require you to request a key if you wish to use more than a certain number of calls an hour</p>
